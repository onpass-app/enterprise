## What is ONPass?
We'll keep it short and sweet; ONPass is a vaccine passport and contact tracing system.

## What inspired ONPass?
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ontario governments push to accelerate vaccinations, there is still a clear need for a system which can verify the vaccination status of individuals and streamline the contact tracing / outbreak reporting process for organizations and the government. Our applications provides an elegant solution to both of these challenges.

## What does the enterprise side do?
There aren't many responsibilites for the enterprise app, it's main responsibility is to scan the QR Code generated by the consumer app in order to track attendees and make contact tracing seamless for organizations.


## What does it look like?
<table>

    <td>Vaccine Receipt QR Code Scanner</td>
    <td>Contact Tracing Modal</td>
  </tr>
